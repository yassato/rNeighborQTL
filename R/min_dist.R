#' Calculating the minimum distance
#'
#' A function to calculate a Euclidian distance including at least one neighbor for all individuals.
#' @param smap A matrix showing a spatial map. The first and second column include spatial points along a x-axis and y-axis, respectively.
#' @param grouping A integer vector assigning each individual to a group. This argument can be useful when a "smap" contains different experimental replicates. Default setting means that all individuals are belong to a single group.
#' @return Return a scalar of the minimum Euclidian distance that allows all individuals to have at least one neighbor.
