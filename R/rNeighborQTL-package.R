#' @title rNeighbor QTL: quantitative trait loci mapping for neighbor effects
#'
#' @description
#' The "rNeighborQTL" package provides a set of functions to perform a genome scan of neighbor QTL effects.
#' See \code{vignette("rNeighborQTL")} for how to use this package.
#' @docType package
#' @name rNeighborQTL-package

#' @details
#' Neighbor QTL is an extended method of single-marker regressions as proposed by Sato et al. (2019).
#' Taking conditional genotype probabilities from \code{r/qtl2} package, the \code{rNeighborQTL} package performs an interval mapping of neighbor genotypic identity.
