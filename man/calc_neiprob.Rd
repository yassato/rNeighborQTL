\title{Calculating a set of neighbor QTL effects from conditional genotype probabilities}
\usage{
calc_neiprob(
  genoprobs,
  gmap,
  a2,
  d2,
  contrasts = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE),
  smap,
  scale,
  grouping = rep(1, nrow(smap))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genoprobs}{Conditional genotype probabilities as obtained from \code{qtl2::calc_genoprob()}.}

\item{gmap}{Genetic map including observed and pseudomarkers, as obtained from \code{qtl2::insert_pseudomarkers()}.}

\item{a2}{A numeric scalar indicating additive deviation.}

\item{d2}{A numeric scalar indicating dominance deviation.}

\item{contrasts}{A vector composed of three TRUE/FALSE values, which represents the presence/absence of specific genotypes as c(T/F, T/F, T/F) = AA, AB, BB.}

\item{smap}{A matrix showing a spatial map. The first and second column include spatial points along a x-axis and y-axis, respectively.}

\item{scale}{A numeric scalar indicating the maximum spatial distance between a focal individual and neighbors to define neighbor effects.}

\item{grouping}{An integer vector assigning each individual to a group. This argument can be useful when \code{smap} contains different experimental replicates. Default setting means that all individuals are belong to a single group.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix containing individuals x marker elements for neighbor QTL effects.
}
\description{
A function to calculate self QTL effects for all individuals, with given deviation coefficients and conditional genotype probabilities.
