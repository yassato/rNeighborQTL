\title{rNeighbor QTL: quantitative trait loci mapping for neighbor effects}
\description{
The "rNeighborQTL" package provides a set of functions to perform a genome scan of neighbor QTL effects.
Theoretical background is described in Sato, Takeda & Nagano (2021).
See \code{vignette("rNeighborQTL")} for how to use this package.
}
\details{
Neighbor QTL is an extended method of single-marker regression.
Taking conditional genotype probabilities from \code{r/qtl} package, the \code{rNeighborQTL} package performs an interval mapping of neighbor genotypic identity.
Alternative to QTL mapping, \code{rNeighborGWAS} package is also available for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) via CRAN at \url{https://cran.r-project.org/package=rNeighborGWAS}.
