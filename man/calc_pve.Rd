\usage{
calc_pve(
  genoprobs,
  pheno,
  gmap,
  contrasts = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE),
  smap,
  s_seq,
  addcovar = NULL,
  grouping = rep(1, nrow(smap)),
  response = "quantitative",
  fig = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genoprobs}{Conditional genotype probabilities as obtained from \code{qtl2::calc_genoprob()}.}

\item{pheno}{A vector of individual phenotypes.}

\item{gmap}{Genetic map including observed and pseudomarkers, as obtained from \code{qtl2::insert_pseudomarkers()}.}

\item{contrasts}{A vector composed of three TRUE/FALSE values. Depending on crossing design, it represents the presence/absence of specific genotypes as c(TRUE/FALSE, TRUE/FALSE, TRUE/FALSE) = AA, AB, BB.}

\item{smap}{A matrix showing a spatial map. The first and second column include spatial points along a x-axis and y-axis, respectively.}

\item{s_seq}{A numeric vector including a set of the maximum spatial distance between a focal individual and neighbors to define neighbor effects. A scalar is also allowed.}

\item{addcovar}{An optional matrix including additional non-genetic covariates. It contains no. of individuals x no. of covariates.}

\item{grouping}{An optional integer vector assigning each individual to a group. This argument can be useful when \code{smap} contains different experimental replicates. Default setting means that all individuals are belong to a single group.}

\item{response}{An optional argument to select trait types. The \code{"quantitative"} or \code{"binary"} applies the \code{"lmm.aireml()"} or \code{"logistic.mm.aireml()"} for a mixed model, respectively.}

\item{fig}{TRUE/FALSE to add a figure of Delta PVE or not.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the maximum neighbor distance, phenotypic variation explained by neighbor effects, and p-value by a likelihood ratio test.
\itemize{
\item{\code{scale}} {Maximum neighbor distance given as an argument}
\item{\code{Var_nei}} {Proportion or ratio of phenotypic variation explained (PVE or RVE) by neighbor effects for linear or logistic mixed models, respectively}
\item{\code{p-value}} {p-value by a likelihood ratio test between models with or without neighbor effects}
}
}
\description{
A function to calculate the proportion or ratio of phenotypic variation explained (PVE or RVE) by neighbor effects for a series of neighbor distance (\code{s_seq}) using mixed models.
}
\details{
This function calls linear or logistic mixed models via the \code{gaston} package (Perdry & Dandine-Roulland 2020).
If \code{"binary"} is selected, \code{Var_nei} in the output is given by the proportion of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by neighbor effects as PVEnei =\eqn{\sigma^2_2/(\sigma^2_1+\sigma^2_2+\sigma^2_e)}.
If \code{"binary"} is selected, \code{Var_nei} is given by the ratio of phenotypic variation explained (RVE) by neighbor effects as RVEnei =\eqn{\sigma^2_2/\sigma^2_1} and p-values are not available.
This is because a logistic mixed model \code{logistic.mm.aireml()} called via the \code{gaston} package does not provide \eqn{\sigma^2_e} and log-likelihood (see Chen et al. 2016 for the theory).
